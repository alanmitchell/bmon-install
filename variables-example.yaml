# Fill out these values to control the installation of BMON on

# installation by executing:
#    ~/bmon-install/install.sh

# BMON is normally installed in the "bmon" directory in your 
# home directory.  If that is OK leave the following variable alone.
# If you'd like it in a different directory, change the "bmon" part of
# the variable below.
install_dir: "{{ lookup('env', 'HOME') }}/bmon"

# Specifiy the domain or subdomain that will be used to access BMON.
# Make sure that the DNS points the domain to this server.
bmon_domain: test.bmon.org

# If you want to be able to access the BMON site through the IP
# address of the server (in addition to a domain name), enter 'yes'
# for the setting below.

# Error messages from the BMON system will be sent to the admin name and 
# email below.
admin_email_name: Alan Mitchell
admin_email_address: tabb99@gmail.com

# An SMTP email server and associated account is needed to allow BMON to
# send emails for Alerts and error messages.  A Gmail account will work with
